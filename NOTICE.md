This library is made available by Snapr under the Mozilla Public Licence.

If you think its cool that we let you use this for free how about considering doing something cool in return:

 * Want a new feature this library doesn't have? Contract us to develop it :)
 * Yes we are also good at designing FX / building apps that use Snapr technology, we could do that for you too.
 * We offer white label licences for the iOS / Android version of our product, you could buy one of those and add Snapr effects to your native app!
 * You could add a link back to [Snapr](http://apps.sna.pr) in the part of your project that uses the library.
